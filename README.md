I am currently writing my master thesis on graph multi-attention networks for brain activity prediction. 
If you have any questions or requests, feel free to write me an e-mail and I will answer as soon as possible. 

I am open for new projects in the field of deep learning and I am espacially curious about a composing A.I. 
or a painting A.I., as I am producing music for myself and want to learn more about it. 


Hear you soon!
